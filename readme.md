# Defodrym-DatabaseAPI

This api repository was created by our team. We created this repository to connect the database from mysql to the API backend using the Hapi framework which will later be deployed to the cloud platform. The url from the compute engine will later be handed over to Android Studio which is handled by the mobile development team.

The section above explains how we created the database and deployed it to the compute engine using the Google Cloud platform. In this case, we not only built the database backend but also created api maps to be given to mobile development in the form of an api key.
