# Defodrym-DatabaseAPI

This api repository was created by our team. We created this repository to connect the database from mysql to the API backend using the Hapi framework which will later be deployed to the cloud platform. The url from the compute engine will later be handed over to Android Studio which is handled by the mobile development team.
